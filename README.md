## About this repository

This repository holds code and analysis that explores storm data from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The purpose of this anaylsis is to determine which types of storms and weather events are most harmful with respect to population health and which events have the greatest economic consequences. 

### What kind of analysis?

From the perspective of the municipal manager seeking to allocate resources to minimize the impact of storms and emergencies, these data can be used to answer important questions. For example:

- Which events cause the most damage?
- Which events are most harmful to population health?
- Where should we allocate resources in the next year to minimize impact from storms?

### Why did you do this work?

This work was originally an assignment from the Coursera course on Reproducible Research. I decided to extend the analysis further out of interest in seeing how data can guide decision-making.

### Can I get a copy of the analysis?

Sure! You can get a copy in the following ways:  

1. Feel free to fork and clone this repo if you want to run the code locally.
2. Checkout the [analysis](storm_impact_analysis.md) for a full walkthrough of the code and analysis from raw file to recommendation. Everything is public and reproducible.
3. Checkout out the [RPub](http://www.rpubs.com/rashanjibowu/stormanalysis). I contains the exact same version as waht appears on GitHub.


### What if I want to extend the analysis?

Go right ahead! If you learn anything new, please submit a pull request with the new insights.

### What if my results disagree with yours?

I'd like to hear about! Please submit a pull request! And please make sure your code and analysis is documented so that we can see where we differ. Thanks!
